# Random Sourcemod plugins

A collection of small Sourcemod plugins for CS:GO, that I am too lazy to make own repositories for.

## sm_extend

A small plugin that allows you to easily add or remove minutes from timelimit.

Usage: `sm_extend <minutes>`, where minutes is a positive or negative integer. Example:
* `sm_extend 10` adds 10 minutes to map time.
* `sm_extend -5` removes 5 minutes from map time.Â¨
